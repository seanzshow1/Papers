## Conference Papers

### Improving Historical Algorithm Recreation Through Systems Thinking: A Study Using Large Language Models and Early Computer Art  
ISEA (International Symposium on Electronic Art)

PDF: [HERE](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/AStudyUsingLargeLanguageModelsandEarlyComputerArt.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper tests whether structuring historical computer art algorithms using systems thinking improves LLM-based reconstruction accuracy. It finds that systems-based representations better preserve conceptual relationships and artistic intent, improving interpretive fidelity while introducing some trade-offs in technical precision.

### Integrating LLMs and RAG for Improved Usability in Multimedia Archives  
ISEA (International Symposium on Electronic Art)

PDF: [HERE](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/Integrating%20LLMs%20and%20RAG%20for%20ImprovedUsabilityinMultimediaArchives.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper explores how semantic embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation enable conversational access to multimedia archives. It demonstrates how AI systems can shift archives from static repositories into interactive environments for knowledge retrieval and creative exploration.

### Advancing Curatorial Practice with Archives using AI  
EVA London 2023 (Electronic Visualisation and the Arts)

PDF: [HERE](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/AdvancingCuratorialPracticewithArchivesUsingAI.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper proposes a framework where AI systems support dynamic interaction with archival collections, incorporating user interpretation as part of archival knowledge. It positions AI as a mechanism for expanding access, supporting creative reuse and enabling dialogic engagement with cultural archives.

### Listen, Scoundrels! A Case Study in AI-Augmented Archival Curation  
EVA London / related curatorial research

PDF: [HERE](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/Listen,%20Scoundrels!ACaseStudyinAI-Augmented%20Archival%20Curation%20_Sean%20Carroll%20%20.docx.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper documents the development of an AI-assisted exhibition using the Computer Arts Society PAGE archive. It demonstrates how AI can augment curatorial analysis and interpretation while preserving human curatorial authority and decision-making.

### Rebuilding Ernest Edmonds’ Communications Game  
EVA London 2022

DOI: [HERE](http://dx.doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2022.12)  
PDF: [HERE](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/RebuildingErnestEdmondsCommunicationGame.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper documents the reconstruction of Ernest Edmonds’ historic interactive artwork using contemporary networked microcontrollers and web technologies. It demonstrates how historical computer artworks can be preserved through modular reconstruction while maintaining their conceptual and behavioural structure.
