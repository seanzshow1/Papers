# Papers – Sean Carroll

Research papers by Sean Carroll as part of my doctoral research (2021–2025) exploring AI, archives and early computer art. These works examine how large language models, retrieval systems and computational methods can support archival interpretation, preservation and curatorial practice.

Author: Sean Carroll  
Writer, producer and curator based in Leicester, UK

## Conference Papers

### Improving Historical Algorithm Recreation Through Systems Thinking: A Study Using Large Language Models and Early Computer Art  
ISEA2025 (International Symposium on Electronic Art) – Short Paper

ISEA record: [ISEA Symposium Archives page](https://www.isea-symposium-archives.org/presentation/improving-historical-algorithm-recreation-through-systems-thinking-a-study-using-large-language-models-and-early-computer-art-presented-by-carroll/)  
PDF (repo): [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/AStudyUsingLargeLanguageModelsandEarlyComputerArt.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper tests whether structuring historical computer art algorithms using systems thinking improves LLM-based reconstruction accuracy. Systems-based representations better preserve conceptual relationships and artistic intent, with trade-offs in mathematical precision.

### Integrating LLMs and RAG for Improved Usability in Multimedia Archives  
ISEA2024 (International Symposium on Electronic Art) – Short Paper

ISEA overview entry: [ISEA2024 presentation overview](https://www.isea-symposium-archives.org/pres-overview/isea2024-presentation-overview/)  
PDF (ISEA-hosted): [PDF](https://www.isea-symposium-archives.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_Sean_Integrating_LLMs_and_RAG_for_Improved_Usability.pdf)  
PDF (repo): [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/Integrating%20LLMs%20and%20RAG%20for%20ImprovedUsabilityinMultimediaArchives.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper explores how semantic embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation enable conversational access to multimedia archives. It frames archives as interactive environments for knowledge retrieval and creative exploration.

### Advancing Curatorial Practice with Archives using AI  
EVA London (Electronic Visualisation and the Arts)

DOI: [https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2024.63](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2024.63)  
Proceedings (EVA London 2024): [https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2024.0](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2024.0)  
EVA publications page: [EVA publications](https://www.eva-london.org/publications/)  
PDF (repo): [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/AdvancingCuratorialPracticewithArchivesUsingAI.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper proposes a framework in which AI supports interaction with archival collections and captures interpretive work as part of archival knowledge. It argues for AI-assisted access that remains accountable to curatorial intent.

Proceedings (EVA London 2025): [https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2025.0](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2025.0)  
EVA publications page: [EVA publications](https://www.eva-london.org/publications/)  
PDF (repo): [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/Listen,%20Scoundrels!ACaseStudyinAI-Augmented%20Archival%20Curation%20_Sean%20Carroll%20%20.docx.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper documents an AI-assisted exhibition using the Computer Arts Society PAGE archive. It shows how AI can support curatorial analysis while keeping interpretive responsibility with the curator.

### Rebuilding Ernest Edmonds’ Communications Game  
EVA London 2022

DOI: [https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2022.12](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2022.12)  
PDF (repo): [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/RebuildingErnestEdmondsCommunicationGame.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper documents the reconstruction of Ernest Edmonds’ historic interactive artwork using contemporary networked microcontrollers and web systems. It argues for modular reconstruction as a preservation approach that retains behavioural structure.
