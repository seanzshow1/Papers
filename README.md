# Papers – Sean Carroll

Research papers by Sean Carroll as part of my doctoral research (2021–2025) exploring AI, archives and early computer art. These works examine how large language models, retrieval systems and computational methods can support archival interpretation, preservation and curatorial practice.

Author: Sean Carroll  
Writer, producer and curator based in Leicester, UK

## Conference Papers

### Improving Historical Algorithm Recreation Through Systems Thinking: A Study Using Large Language Models and Early Computer Art  
ISEA (International Symposium on Electronic Art)

PDF: [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/AStudyUsingLargeLanguageModelsandEarlyComputerArt.pdf)  
Repository record: [HERE](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers)

Summary:  
This paper tests whether structuring historical computer art algorithms using systems thinking improves LLM-based reconstruction accuracy. Systems-based representations better preserve conceptual relationships and artistic intent, improving interpretive fidelity while introducing some trade-offs in mathematical precision.

### Integrating LLMs and RAG for Improved Usability in Multimedia Archives  
ISEA (International Symposium on Electronic Art)

PDF: [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/Integrating%20LLMs%20and%20RAG%20for%20ImprovedUsabilityinMultimediaArchives.pdf)  
Repository record: [HERE](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers)

Summary:  
This paper explores how semantic embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation enable conversational access to multimedia archives. It demonstrates how AI systems can transform archives from static repositories into interactive environments for knowledge retrieval and creative exploration.

### Advancing Curatorial Practice with Archives using AI  
Electronic Visualisation and the Arts (EVA London)

DOI: [https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2024.63](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2024.63)  
Publisher page: [BCS Electronic Workshops in Computing](https://ewic.bcs.org/category/17671)  
PDF: [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/AdvancingCuratorialPracticewithArchivesUsingAI.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper proposes a framework in which AI systems support dynamic interaction with archival collections, incorporating interpretation data as part of archival knowledge. It positions AI as a mechanism for expanding access and supporting creative and curatorial engagement.

### Listen, Scoundrels! A Case Study in AI-Augmented Archival Curation  
Electronic Visualisation and the Arts (EVA London)

DOI: [https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2025.7](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2025.7)  
Publisher page: [BCS Electronic Workshops in Computing](https://ewic.bcs.org/category/17671)  
PDF: [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/Listen,%20Scoundrels!ACaseStudyinAI-Augmented%20Archival%20Curation%20_Sean%20Carroll%20%20.docx.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper documents the development of an AI-assisted exhibition using the Computer Arts Society PAGE archive. It demonstrates how AI can augment curatorial analysis while preserving human curatorial authority and interpretive responsibility.

### Rebuilding Ernest Edmonds’ Communications Game  
Electronic Visualisation and the Arts (EVA London 2022)

DOI: [https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2022.12](https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/EVA2022.12)  
Publisher page: https://ewic.bcs.org/content/ConWebDoc/88750  
PDF: [PDF](https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/RebuildingErnestEdmondsCommunicationGame.pdf)

Summary:  
This paper documents the reconstruction of Ernest Edmonds’ historic interactive artwork using contemporary networked microcontrollers and web systems. It demonstrates how historical computer artworks can be preserved through modular reconstruction while maintaining their conceptual and behavioural structure.
