## Conference Papers

### Improving Historical Algorithm Recreation Through Systems Thinking: A Study Using Large Language Models and Early Computer Art  
ISEA2025 – International Symposium on Electronic Art

ISEA page: [HERE](https://www.isea-symposium-archives.org/presentation/improving-historical-algorithm-recreation-through-systems-thinking-a-study-using-large-language-models-and-early-computer-art-presented-by-carroll/)  
PDF: [HERE](AStudyUsingLargeLanguageModelsandEarlyComputerArt.pdf)

Summary:  
Tests whether a systems-thinking representation improves LLM reconstructions of historic computer art algorithms. Finds improved capture of intent and relationships, with some trade-offs in mathematical precision.
