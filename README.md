## Conference Papers

### Improving Historical Algorithm Recreation Through Systems Thinking: A Study Using Large Language Models and Early Computer Art  
ISEA2025 – International Symposium on Electronic Art

PDF (repo):  
https://github.com/seanzshow1/Papers/blob/main/AStudyUsingLargeLanguageModelsandEarlyComputerArt.pdf

Summary:  
This paper tests whether structuring historical computer art algorithms using systems thinking improves LLM-based reconstruction accuracy. Systems-based representations better preserve conceptual relationships and artistic intent while introducing some trade-offs in mathematical precision.
